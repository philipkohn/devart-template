## Description
Technology has put the world's knowledge at our fingertips, leaving us with the much harder question:
what do we want to know.  With a creative spark, we can pull in knowledge to create the bonfire of an idea.  But where does the spark come from?  Most creative ideas are dismissed when we are barely aware of them.  How can we provide kindling, allowing us to take the spark seriously long enough to ignite?

What might technology have to offer to this process?  
Can we manipulate an environment to increase the likelihood of these creative sparks?

While science, engineering and technology have concentrated on the process of getting from point A to point B,
art has addressed questions like, why point A, and what about point Q?
The arts are all about creativity and inspiration.
My goal is to make a piece that uses technology as a tool to spark inspiration and augment creativity.
