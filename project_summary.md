## Description
Technology has put the world's knowledge at our fingertips, leaving us with the much harder question:
what do we want to know.  With a creative spark, we can pull in knowledge to create the bonfire of an idea.  But where does the spark come from?  Most creative ideas are dismissed when we are barely aware of them.  How can we provide kindling, allowing us to take the spark seriously long enough to ignite?

Many have said that the spark comes from the unconscious mind.  The unconscious mind allows ideas to flow together without the requirements that reasoning and consciousness demand.  Some of the best creative people have used the strategy of using the conscious mind to survey the landscape, then proceeded
to spend time not thinking about it.  Sometimes unrelated or random events will provide the seed around which an idea will crystalize.  Other times it is the interplay of ideas between people that amplifies the creative generator.  Art can allow us to look at the world differently, giving us the impulse of a seed.

What might technology have to offer to this process?  
Can we manipulate an environment that stimulates this sort of process.

What I would put forward is that it is very difficult to be creative in a vacuum.
Our own ideas, if left to themselves, tend to go around in the same paths that become trenches that are hard to see out of.  The problem with jumping off the path is the vast multi-dimensional space out there.  Without
some landmark or compass, it is hard to even see anything.  We need social interactions, semi-random seeds, emotional triggers, distractions, visualization, loose conscious control, reduced self-talk, cross talk with other domains.
The secret of creativity may be introducing the right randomness that pushes us off the beaten path in just the right direction.
