## Description
It is often said that information and social network technologies have created a global village.  There is a sense that distance is irrelevant and the huge number of people on the planet is likewise irreverent.  The dynamics have returned to that of small groups interacting in a shared living environment.  There is a e-village focused on anything that can be imagined.  Although people may belong to several e-villages, the e-villages themselves often do not interact directly as groups.  Within these wonderful collaborative environments, there is still a level of isolation.  People mostly talk to the people that share the same viewpoint, beliefs and interests.  The potential for cross-pollination (which is the essence of creativity) between all these villages is enormous, and mostly untapped.

Can I piece of art be made that symbolizes this paradox, and tries in a small way to resolve it?

In a darkened room there is a large (bigger than human scale) glowing earth (as seen from space, spinning, with clouds moving).  As you get closer to the earth you see your own face (real time video) overlay on the earth.  As you watch, your face becomes larger and more solid.  When you say a word, that word appears next to you on the globe.  Words move away from your face and collide with words from other people to generate pictures and videos (using Google image search, and youtube â€“ with filtering!!).  Other words related to the words that are coming together start to appear (words start small and get bigger if they collide with other semantically related words).  When a word is the name of a place, the globe could spin so that place faces the person, and then images and videos related to that place could come up.  Maybe Google+ groups related to these word clusters could be used to bring up other words, images or videos.  The words and face videos are saved so that they can reappear later even with that person is not present, if triggered by words spoken by people who are there.  The whole thing could also be available as a Google+ hangout so people could interact with it remotely.
