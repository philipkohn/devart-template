I tried again using my large LCD monitor instead of the laptop.
The problem is that I’m still seeing a fine vertical grating.
Closing one eye reduces it, and it is sort of strange that I can see it even when my eye is almost touching the screen.
When I move my head, it moves at a different velocity.
I think it must be some sort of diffraction or interference effect.
I’m wondering if some types of LCD don’t have this.
It would be so much simpler if I could just use a regular screen of some sort without additional optical elements.
So I started to think about diffusers.
I wandered around my office trying things.
Paper had too much pattern in it.
I finally found a frosted Nalgeen type bottle that I could hold next to my eyes.
I should just go out and get some ping pong balls, and cut them in half, just to have a baseline.
I just want to see something, some imagery.
Sort of the “hello world” of ganzfeld.
If I could get that going, then I could start to play with it.
Try to optimization the time to induce it.
Try to manipulate it.

I think the light field has to be very uniform.
The key is to give each retinal cell a constant signal despite eye movements.
After a long time with the Nalgene bottle I think I did start to see some sort of structure starting to appear.
Just as it was getting interesting the screen saver cut the screen to black.
For a fraction of a second I really thought something amazing had happened.
Oh well.

Here is my current idea:
In front of the eyes would be a half-silver mirror at 45 degrees.
Above the mirror, would be a small screen (maybe a tablet) and diffuser.
A larger screen would be in front of the mirror to provide the subtle influences once the ganzfeld effect is going.
For a first attempt, maybe a regular piece of glass would be good enough since it will reflect some light off of its surface.
I think all I need is a high quality diffuser.
I’m sure there is something around the house, so I’ll keep looking.
Maybe a container filled with milk (which I just ran out of, so maybe almond milk?).
I might have to order something.

I guess if the subtle perturbations of the light field are going to be relatively smooth, maybe I could just put a diffuser over the screen and do away with the mirror, etc.
It could be that putting an image with sharp edges in there would destroy the effect.
I was hoping to make it subtle by just having it be very dim.
I think I need the mirror just to explore all the possibilities, to be sure that this whole idea would not work if that is the case.


Since I’m assuming the light field has to be as uniform as possible, there are a limited number of parameters to play with:
The overall color and intensity, and also maybe very slow changes in color and intensity.
