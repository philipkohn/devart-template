Looking again at the big picture for “eye zoom”

What is the difference between a technological demonstration and a piece of art?
If there was a regular screen, a computer, eye tracking glasses and an assortment of gigapixel images, then that would clearly be a tech demo.  Moving to the opposite extreme in all these aspects doesn’t make it art.  Art is more focused on a specific idea or narrative or feeling that touches the audience in such a way as to make a positive change their view of the world.  It gives them something they didn’t have, something they needed at a deep level.  I hate to work from the technological tools backwards to the artistic.   It is better to start with the feeling, and then work out the tech details that best produce it.  Since this is an honest stream of consciousness, I will not hide the fact that often I think about things in whatever way seems like it might help get me where I need to go. 

Looking at some of the gigapixel images that are available, I found a 320 gigapixel image of London that claims to be the worlds biggest picture.  http://360gigapixels.com/london-320-gigapixel-panorama/
There is an interesting tension between the beauty of London as a huge, multilayered sculpture, and on the other hand the voyeuristic, creepy way that you can see into windows and take in everything with an almost god-like omnipresence.   A city has a huge amount of variety.  By design, there is something in there for everyone.  

I’m thinking about the container or presentation for this piece.  What to put London inside?  Something small, just to add an element of surprise and contrast.  Something unassuming, mundane, ordinary.  A shoebox?  Could call it “London in a shoebox.”  

What could be more interesting, although getting more into surveillance-art  (certainly a growing genre), would be to have a gigapan setup on the roof of the building and maybe inside the building (in a large open indoor area).  Gigapixel images could be made continuously throughout the day so that you could see real-time time-lapse images of anything within the zoom range in any direction.  It would be truly a god-like eye.
