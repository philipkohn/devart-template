I have a feeling that tetris is not the right game.  
It is too easy to put a label on it and then dismiss it.  
Also the spatial matching part of the game does not contribute to the whole of the piece. 
Now I’m thinking that the matching should be something harder to define.
Maybe a part of the game is to figure out what the game is.
The matching should be based on meaning/concepts since that is the playground that this piece is playing on.
Trying to start out as simple as possible.
This is something that art and science have in common: you start by trying to simplify as much as possible.
Include only what contributes, and eliminate anything that doesn’t contribute.
Say the game is to match a picture (or word) to a set of other pictures (or words).
The game is to figure out what constitutes a match.
The rules of the game may change just when the participant thinks they have it figured out (that makes it like life).
It could be related to a lot of things like similar meaning, opposite meaning, shared context, etc.
Once the participant makes a choice they are given some feedback, right or wrong.
Maybe they are shown the correct choice if they got it wrong, though it may be better without that.
(Maybe sometimes they get the correct answer and sometimes not.)

Add to this game a focus on unconscious or subconscious.
Say that they see a very quick, subliminal, sequence of words or pictures.
Maybe the game actually depends on matching the subliminal information to the target pictures/words.
Unknown to the participant they are learning to be more aware of the subliminal information, and thereby their own unconscious, as they play.

The piece could attempt to seed the unconscious with concepts and ideas that promote creativity.
There are a lot of lists of creativity inducing suggestions that people have come up with.
One of my favorites is Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies.
The suggestions should be somewhat nonsensical, since we are trying to short circuit logical thinking.
Maybe the game would involve trying to match things in the most creative way.
I’m not sure what that means at this point.

I did some research on Ganzfeld stimulation and hit the jackpot.   This maybe one of the few things that has a huge crackpot literature and a significant scientific literature as well! 
It seems the journal Cortex had a special issue in 2008.
I found this paper:

(The link may not work unless you have a subscription.  I have one through NIH where I work)

The paper is titled:
Ganzfeld-induced hallucinatory experience, its phenomenology and cerebral electrophysiology
It has a lot of information about the induction protocols and setups.
I’m really excited about how much scientific information there is about this!
I think I’ll change the name of this project to Ganzulator.
They do use white noise auditory stimulation, so that was on the right track.
The visual field has to be very uniform, so there are some technical problems to solve there:
How to have a computer projection and at the same time allow for a super uniform stimulation from all angles.

I think that soon I will have to start touching reality here given the limited time available.
One nice thing about subliminal experiments are that I can test it on myself and still be completely scientific about.
My plan is to make a simple program that shows a subliminal sequence of words and then gives you a choice of other words, one of which is related to the sequence, and the others are not.
There are a lot of technical details to work out here as well.
I need to select a corpus of text to work with, and select related and unrelated words.
Also the programming environment needs to be selected.
Since I need to use some google stuff, I’m thinking I will prototype this in Go.
I’ve never used it, but it looks pretty good.  I like the multithreading, and simple graphical interface.

Another meta-comment:
I’ve never tried to design a piece by doing a daily writing ritual, but I really like it so far. 
Usually, I’d come up with some ideas, make some notes, and then think about it every now and then.
This way is more intensive, and also I think I’m seeing the problems more quickly and changing directions more often.
I don’t know if anyone is really reading all this, but the fact that someone might be reading it makes a difference.
It is like seeing a movie with other people.
You can see it more objectively because you are thinking about how other people are seeing it.
That is a part of the design of this piece.
It is social in the sense that there are a many people experiencing it together, even though they don’t directly interact (at least not in the current version).
It is like working at Starbucks to take in the atmosphere, which somehow helps.
